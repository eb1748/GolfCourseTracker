# Golf Course Tracker

This is a full-stack web application that helps golf enthusiasts track their progress through America's top 100 public golf courses. The application provides an interactive map interface where users can mark courses as "played," "want to play," or "not played," search for specific courses, and visualize their golf destination journey. Built with modern web technologies, it offers both map and list views with filtering capabilities, creating an engaging exploration-focused experience similar to travel platforms like Airbnb and AllTrails.

## Project Overview

This application allows users to browse and interact with golf course data. Authentication is **optional** - the app works fully for anonymous users, with login only required for persistent data storage across devices.

## Current Status âœ… FIXED

**RESOLVED**: Authentication system has been updated to support anonymous users.

### âœ… Fixed Issues (2025-09-14):
- `/api/auth/me` now returns `{"user": null}` instead of 401 error for anonymous users
- `/api/courses` and related endpoints now work without authentication
- Frontend gracefully handles unauthenticated users
- App works immediately for anonymous users without requiring login
- Anonymous user data stored in localStorage with option to sync when logging in

### âœ… Current Behavior:
- âœ… Anonymous users can view and interact with golf courses
- âœ… Anonymous users can mark courses as played/want-to-play (stored locally)
- âœ… Anonymous users get full app functionality without login
- âœ… Login provides data persistence across devices and sync capabilities
- âœ… Smooth upgrade path from anonymous to authenticated user

## Development Notes

### Authentication System âœ… UPDATED
- **Type**: Express-session with PostgreSQL session store
- **Status**: âœ… Modified to support optional authentication
- **Anonymous Users**: Full app access with localStorage persistence
- **Authenticated Users**: Cross-device sync + persistent storage
- **Migration Path**: Anonymous data automatically syncs when user logs in

### API Endpoints âœ… UPDATED
- `/api/auth/me` - âœ… Returns `{user: null}` for anonymous users
- `/api/courses` - âœ… Works without authentication (returns courses with default status)
- `/api/courses/search` - âœ… Search courses (anonymous friendly)
- `/api/courses/status/:status` - âœ… Filter by status (anonymous friendly)
- `/api/users/me/stats` - âœ… User statistics (works for anonymous users)
- `/api/courses/:courseId/status` - âœ… **FIXED** Update course status with CORS support and fallback storage
- `/api/auth/signin` - Login endpoint
- `/api/auth/signup` - Registration endpoint
- `/api/auth/signout` - Logout endpoint
- `/api/auth/sync` - Sync localStorage data to authenticated account

### Course Status Update System âœ… FIXED (2025-09-15)

The course status update functionality has been completely overhauled for reliability:

#### **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/courses/:courseId/status`
- **Request**: `{ status: 'played' | 'want-to-play' | 'not-played' }`
- **CORS Enabled**: Full cross-origin support with proper headers
- **Authentication**: Optional - works for both authenticated and anonymous users

#### **Error Handling & Status Codes**:
- **200**: Successfully updated course status
- **400**: Invalid course status data or malformed request
- **404**: Golf course not found in database
- **503**: Database temporarily unavailable (fallback storage used)
- **500**: General server error with detailed logging

#### **Storage Strategy**:
- **Authenticated Users**: Primary storage in PostgreSQL database
- **Anonymous Users**: Local-only storage with sync option on login
- **Database Failures**: Automatic fallback to in-memory storage
- **Connection Issues**: Graceful degradation with user feedback

#### **Reliability Features**:
- Course existence validation before status updates
- Atomic database operations with conflict resolution
- Comprehensive error logging for production debugging
- Primary/fallback storage pattern for high availability
- Database connection testing before operations

## Deployment

- **Platform**: Railway
- **Database**: Railway PostgreSQL
- **Status**: âœ… Migrated from Replit - Database persistence issues resolved

## Recent Changes

### âœ… Replit to Railway Migration Fixes (2025-09-15)
**CRITICAL**: Fixed user accounts saving to memory instead of PostgreSQL database

**Root Cause**: Multiple Replit-specific configurations were incompatible with Railway deployment, causing user registration to default to memory storage instead of database persistence.

**Major Fixes Implemented**:
- **Database Driver Migration**: Replaced `@neondatabase/serverless` with standard `pg` PostgreSQL driver
  - Resolved hostname rewriting bug (Neon driver incorrectly connecting to `api.proxy.rlwy.net` instead of `nozomi.proxy.rlwy.net`)
  - Ensures proper Railway PostgreSQL connections
- **Removed Replit Dependencies**: Eliminated all Replit-specific configurations
  - Removed `@replit/vite-plugin-cartographer` and `@replit/vite-plugin-runtime-error-modal` from Vite
  - Removed Replit development banner script from `index.html`
  - Updated server proxy configuration for Railway deployment
- **Storage System Overhaul**: Eliminated problematic fallback logic
  - Removed MemStorage fallback in signup route to force DatabaseStorage usage
  - Enhanced database connection logging and error handling
  - Fixed drizzle configuration for standard PostgreSQL connections

**Impact**:
- âœ… **User accounts now persist to PostgreSQL** instead of memory
- âœ… **DatabaseStorage properly selected** (no more MemStorage fallback)
- âœ… **Eliminated hostname resolution errors** from Neon driver
- âœ… **Railway-compatible database connections** established
- âœ… **All Replit artifacts removed** from codebase

### âœ… Course Status Update Fixes (2025-09-15)
- **Fixed 500 errors**: Course status updates (`POST /api/courses/:courseId/status`) now work reliably
- **CORS configuration**: Added comprehensive CORS headers to support cross-origin API calls
- **Enhanced database operations**: Improved connection testing, course validation, and error handling
- **Fallback storage**: Automatic fallback to in-memory storage when database is unavailable
- **Anonymous user support**: Course status updates work for both authenticated and anonymous users
- **Detailed error handling**: Specific HTTP status codes (404, 503, 400) with meaningful error messages
- **Comprehensive logging**: Enhanced debugging capabilities for production troubleshooting

### âœ… Authentication System Overhaul (2025-09-14)
- **Modified middleware**: Changed `requireAuth` to `attachUserIfAuthenticated` on public endpoints
- **Updated `/api/auth/me`**: Now returns `{user: null}` instead of 401 for anonymous users
- **Fixed frontend auth handling**: AuthContext gracefully handles anonymous users
- **Enhanced API routes**: All golf course endpoints work without authentication
- **Preserved user experience**: Anonymous users get full functionality with localStorage persistence

### âœ… Server Stability & Resilience Fixes
- **Fixed server startup crashes**: Database connection failures no longer crash the server
- **Added graceful database fallbacks**: API endpoints use static course data when database unavailable
- **Enhanced error handling**: All endpoints return proper JSON responses instead of 500 errors
- **Improved initialization**: Non-blocking database initialization prevents startup failures
- **Session store fallbacks**: Memory sessions when PostgreSQL unavailable

### ðŸ”§ Technical Details
- **Backend**: Updated `server/routes.ts` middleware for anonymous access + fallback data
- **Frontend**: Modified `AuthContext.tsx` to handle null user state properly
- **Database**: Schema already supported anonymous users - no changes needed
- **Storage**: Dual-mode system (localStorage for anonymous, PostgreSQL for authenticated)
- **Error Handling**: Static golf course data fallbacks for all major endpoints

## API Resilience & Fallback System

The application now features a robust fallback system that ensures functionality even when the database is unavailable:

### **Fallback Mechanisms:**
- **Static Course Data**: `FULL_TOP_100_GOLF_COURSES` serves as backup when database fails
- **Memory Sessions**: Falls back to in-memory session storage if PostgreSQL unavailable
- **Graceful Degradation**: API endpoints return valid JSON responses instead of 500 errors
- **Non-blocking Initialization**: Server starts successfully even with database connection issues

### **Endpoints with Fallback Support:**
- `/api/courses` - Returns static golf course data with default 'not-played' status
- `/api/courses/search` - Searches static data using client-side filtering
- `/api/users/me/stats` - Returns default stats based on static course count
- `/api/auth/me` - Returns `{user: null}` for anonymous users instead of errors

### **Production Benefits:**
- **High Availability**: App works even during database maintenance
- **Anonymous User Support**: Immediate functionality without database dependency
- **Fault Tolerance**: Temporary database issues don't crash the application
- **Development Flexibility**: Local development works without database setup
